What is Automation Testing
-Automation Testing- is a process of automating a manual testing process of an application or system by using testing tools
                    that allow you to create scripts that can be executed repeatedly,generating test reports of the application
                    under test

Advantages of Automated tests
-It supports both the performance and functional testing of an application or system
-It allows parallel execution of test cases
-It improves accuracy and efficiency of the system by reducing the manual intervention of human generate test cases
-It facilitates the execution of the test cases
-It helps in testing a large scale test matrix
-It saves valuable time and money for the testing team involved in project

why should selenium be selected as a testing tool for web application or systems
-It is free and open-source software with a large user base and supports providing community
-It has cross browser compatibility and supports multiple browsers e.g Chrome,FireFox,IE,Safari
-It supports multiple operating systems
-It facilitates the usages of multiple programming languages
-It provides support for distributed testing as well

Disadvantages of using Selenium as a testing tool
-Tests web applications only
-No built-in reporting and test management facility-Selenium can generate reports only using third party tools TestNG
-Unavailability of reliable tech support
-May require the knowing the programming languages

What is Selenium Suite and what are its different components
-Selenium is a package of several testing tools and therefore often referred to as a Selenium Suite with each these tools
designed to cater to a different testing requirements

Different Components of Selenium Suite
-Selenium Integrated Development Environment(IDE)-It is a FireFox/Chrome plug-in that is developed to speed up the creation
of automation scripts by recording the user actions on the web browser and exporting them as a reusable script
-Selenium Remote Control(RC)It is a server that enables users to generate test scripts in their preferred programming
languages
-Selenium WebDriver-It a programming interface that helps create and run test cases by directly communicating with the web
browser and using its native compatibility to automate.It not require additional server to create and run test cases.
-Selenium Grid-It allows parallel execution of tests on different browsers and operating systems

Selenium Commands

1. Actions-These are the commands interacting directly with web applications
2. Accessors-These are the commands that allow users to store values to a user-defined variable
3. Assertions-They enable a comparison of the current state of the application with its expected state

What is meant by locators
-A locator is an address for uniquely identifying web elements within a web page

Types of locators
-ID
-ClassName
-Name
-TagName
-LinkText
-Xpath
-CSS Selector
-DOM
